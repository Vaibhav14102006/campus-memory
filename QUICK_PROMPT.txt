Create a professional Streamlit dashboard to showcase my Event Guidance ML Model with 3 pages:

**PAGE 1 - ML MODEL OVERVIEW:**
- Show model architecture diagram: Data → Features → Random Forest (100 trees) → Predictions
- Display key specs: 100K records, 11 features, 26.6% accuracy, 50ms speed
- Visual flow diagram with data pipeline
- 5 metric cards at bottom: Training samples, Features, Trees, Accuracy, Speed
- Status indicator: "MODEL ACTIVE"

**PAGE 2 - LIVE PREDICTIONS (INTERACTIVE):**
- Left sidebar: Input form with dropdowns/sliders for:
  - Event selection (14 events)
  - Student branch (CSE, IT, ECE, etc.)
  - Academic year (1-4)
  - Skill level (Beginner to Expert)
  - Previous participation (None to High)
  - Team size (1-5)
  - Large "PREDICT" button

- Right side (70%): Results display
  - **Top row:** 2 large animated circular gauges:
    1. Predicted Satisfaction (0-10 scale, color zones)
    2. Model Confidence (0-100%, based on tree variance)
  
  - **Middle row:** 2 charts side-by-side:
    1. Histogram of 100 tree predictions
    2. Top 8 feature importance bars for this prediction
  
  - **Bottom:** Summary box with prediction details, processing time

- Animations: Gauges sweep smoothly, charts fade in, all updates within 2 seconds

**PAGE 3 - MODEL PERFORMANCE:**
- Top left: Scatter plot (Actual vs Predicted) with 20K test points
- Top right: Metric cards (R², MAE, RMSE, Speed)
- Bottom left: Overall feature importance bar chart (all 11 features)
- Bottom right: Key insights text box + sample predictions table

**TECHNICAL SPECS:**
- Use existing Random Forest model from event_feedback_dataset.csv
- 11 features: event_encoded, type_encoded, level_encoded, branch_encoded, student_year, gender_encoded, skill_encoded, prev_encoded, team_size, participated_alone, event_duration_days
- Train on 80% data, test on 20%
- Cache model with @st.cache_resource
- Predictions must be < 100ms

**DESIGN:**
- Colors: Blue (#3b82f6), Green (#10b981), Red (#dc2626)
- Large fonts: 36px headers, 18px body, 48px metric numbers
- Sidebar navigation with icons
- Professional look for projector presentations
- Smooth animations on prediction updates
- White/light background, clean modern style

**KEY REQUIREMENTS:**
- Model status always visible
- Confidence scores show reliability
- Feature importance explains predictions
- Fast enough for live demos
- Looks impressive on big screens

Use Streamlit, Plotly for interactive charts, sklearn for model. Should run with: `streamlit run app.py`
